# Advent_of_Code24
**My solutions for the Advent of Code of the year 2024**

## Intro:

Hello, World!
In here, I'm trying to solve the Advent of Code tasks and show my working steps.

Each task has its own working folder with mostly just a main.py file.
As you might think now, I mainly work in Python for this.

## Structure:
~~~
MagicBardo/
  AoC24/
    inputs/
        day1.txt
        day2.txt
        ...
    AoC24_1_1/
      main.py
    AoC24_1_2/
      main.py
    AoC24_2_1/
      main.py
    AoC24_.../
      ...

## Download / Usage:

If you are interested in testing my solutions *yourself*, feel free to download the project and use it for yourself, but please not for commercial stuff ... if it would even be good enough for that ... <br>
Note that the input for each task is available on the AoC24 Website (**link**) and needs to be put into a file by yourself before using my code. You also may need to change the file path to your specific location.
